# DBSCAN Clustering with New Data Points Prediction

This notebook demonstrates the process of clustering data using the DBSCAN algorithm and predicting cluster labels for new data points. The workflow includes:

1. **Generating Sample Data**: Creating a synthetic dataset for clustering.
2. **Training the DBSCAN Model**: Applying the DBSCAN algorithm to the generated data.
3. **Predicting Labels for New Data Points**: Using the trained DBSCAN model to classify new data points.
4. **Visualization**: Plotting the original data clusters along with the predicted labels for the new points.
